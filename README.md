"Posture and Mood Monitoring Using Deep Learning" project is a real-time posture and mood monitoring application using computer vision and deep learning techniques. 
The app utilizes OpenCV for video processing, Mediapipe for posture detection, and a CNN based custom model for mood detection. 
The application is built with Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
