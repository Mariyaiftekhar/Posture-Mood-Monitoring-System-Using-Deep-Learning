"Posture and Mood Monitoring Using Deep Learning" project is a real-time posture and mood monitoring application using computer vision and deep learning techniques. 
The Streamlit based app utilizes OpenCV for video processing, Mediapipe for posture detection, and a CNN based custom model for mood detection. 
This project is consists of two models: Emotion Detection using CNN and Mediapipe body landmarks detection based Posture model. Both models are integrated into the Streamlit App.

## Features
1. Real-time Posture Detection: Monitors and classifies posture as either correct or incorrect.
2. Real-time Mood Detection: Detects and classifies mood into categories such as happy, sad, neutral, and disgust.
3. Time Tracking: Keeps track of the time spent in different postures and moods.
4. Interactive Visualization: Provides insights into posture and mood statistics using pie charts.
5. Alerts: Alerts the user when incorrect posture is detected or when it's time to take a rest.
6. Contact Form: Allows users to send messages or feedback via a contact form.
